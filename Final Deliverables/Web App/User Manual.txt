This link will lead you to an EForm the students should fill out in the lobby or before the first day of class.

The form will prompt the student for the following information:
	First Name
	Last Name
	Rank
	Unit
	Phone Number
	Current on fitness?		yes/no
	Are you on a profile?	yes/no
	
Once the submit button is pressed, a QR code containing this information is generated.

This QR code isn't stored anywhere on the web.

The student should then save the QR code for the day of their check-in.

The save button automatically downloads a PNG file contiaining their QR code.

The form is simple enough to fill out that it could be done in the lobby.

On check-in day, the student should scan their QR code at the barcode scanner on the front of the kiosk with the kiosk app running.
