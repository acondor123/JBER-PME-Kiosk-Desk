In order to operate this app, you simply need to open kiosk.py.

Once open, you can double tap/click anywhere on the user interface and it will go full screen.

At this point, the QR codes are ready to scan.

Simply scan the QR code at the sensor located at the front of the machine and let the kiosk do the processing.

When the screen displays a loading icon, it means it's processing the scan.   No additional action should be taken at this time.

If the screen displays a warning, then the scan has failed and it will not update to the spreadsheet.

If the scan was successful, the screen will display a green checkmark indicating a good scan.

Once a good scan is completed, a spreadsheet located in the "Spreadsheets" folder will either populate or update with the relevant information.

The spreadsheets are automatically named in the following format:
	dd-Month-yyyy.xlsx
	02-May-2024.xlsx
	
Each row is added in the order the students scan the QR codes and cannot be reversed unless the spreadsheets themselves are updated.

If any problems are encountered ensure the following folders with the appropriate files are located in the same file path as kiosk.py:
	images
	resources
	spreadsheets
	
In the images folder, there should be files called checkmark.gif, loading.gif, and pmelogo.png.

In the resources folder there should be a file called validate.py.
