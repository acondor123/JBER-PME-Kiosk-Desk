With collaboration from the Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson Professional Military Education Center (JBER PME), the goal of this project was to expedite the check-in process for hundreds of students attending Air Force leadership training. It was developed in a two-part system, utilizing a website for student input and a kiosk interface for QR code scanning. The website, built using Python Flask, generates QR codes containing essential student information, while the kiosk app, developed with PyQt5, validates and processes the scanned QR codes, ensuring security and accuracy. The integrated system significantly reduces administrative burdens, allowing instructors to focus on essential duties during student in-processing.
